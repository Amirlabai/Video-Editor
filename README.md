# Video-Editor
pyton script for compressing and joining video files, essentially UI for few ffmpeg tools

It will not work if you dont have ffmpeg installed!

ffmpeg setting are hard coded and yet to be robust, further updates and it will be available.
processing will get videos down to 1280:720 ratio, aac 128k
normal h.264 video format, fast -ffmpeg setting and mid-tier conversion(28).

may update to 30 fps and keep it low as a file compressor as a tool without any free controls.
As far as I'm concerned haven't added any libraries that aren't readily available
